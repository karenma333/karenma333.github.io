							<h4>Shifting from B2B to B2B2C: An alternative experience for the novice user base</h4>

							<h4>Context</h4>
							<div>
								<div>
									<p>Following a pivot in product strategy from financial advisors to the every day user, I worked to reframe our existing product for a more novice user base, including a simplified onboarding flow and educational dashboard experience.  </p>							
									<p>For this project, I worked on the onboarding and dashboard designs with a team of two other designers, as well as leading the technical integrations with 401k plan providers. This was also the first introduction of user experience design into the product development process, requiring design evangelization to the org. </p>							
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h4>Solution</h4>
							<div>
								<div>
									<p>I led generative research to shape our design strategy for the new target audience and set up usability metrics to inform iterations as we started shipping our features. Novice users were overwhelmed by personalization options in the original interface and needed more education on recommended actions. Not only did we see an increase in users, we also saw better outcomes for our users, for a product-led growth strategy. </p>

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
