								<p>Looking at user analytics, two-thirds of users who were interested in customization were going into their profile data but not making any changes. In addition, I learned that the data we receive isn&#x27;t guaranteed to be correct. Since users were interested in understanding what profile data we had on them, the set-up process, which displays the profile data, was made to be required for all users.</p>

								<p>Not all the customization options provided to a user are as easy as a Yes/No. For some, users need an expected time of up to 5 minutes to complete the set up. Looking at user activity, the drop-off rates indicated that users were caught off guard. This was resolved by adding a progress indicators and language to reference expected time.</p>

								<p>While the initial solution sought to streamline our enrollment process, and we have successfully moved from a nine-step wizard to a one-step wizard. After talking to subject matter experts, I learned that the most important steps for users to interact with were in the last few steps where we were seeing less than 20% interaction. The original wizard was lengthy in order to prove users with a sense of customization but failed to actually encourage customization. Enrollment rates have increased by 60%. 20% of users are willingly engaging in customization.</p>
