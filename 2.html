									<p>What happens when a feature is released and isn’t as successful as you hoped? In this case, I worked to understand how the released functionality did manage to improve user workflows and what prevented the feature from becoming even more useful. Additional user research informed tweaks to how the existing features operated to improve adoption and usage.</p>

									<h3 role="heading" aria-level="2">  Product Opportunity</h3>
									<p>In an effort to provide users with more visibility into their automations, a basic execution history and upcoming schedule was created for users. While conducting user research on a related project, it became clear that the MVP feature release of an automated jobs execution history and jobs schedule did not fully solve user problems. Instead of providing clarity, this actually brought about more questions and concerns about jobs. </p>

									<h3 role="heading" aria-level="2">  Synthesis</h3>
									<p>One of the goals in releasing this feature set was to decrease the workload on our support team. By letting customers see the status of their automated jobs, they would not feel the need to ask our support team to confirm everything was working as expected. I sat down with our users and our support team separately to understand how the features changed their workflow and what the current dynamic looked like. Ultimately, it came down to two things. </p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<ul>
										<li>Users disagreed with our definitions. Our decisions for what job executions succeeded or failed didn’t make sense to the users. </li>
										<li>They wanted more details. It wasn’t enough to know that a job had failed, users needed to know why something failed. Likewise, if a job claims to have succeeded but they didn’t see evidence, they wanted reassurance of what actions were actually executed.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3 role="heading" aria-level="2">  Automations History</h3>
									<p>Previously, we only had two statuses, &#x27;success&#x27; and &#x27;failed&#x27; and users often did not understand why something was identified as &#x27;failed&#x27;. I expanded the execution statuses and added explanations to provide users with more clarity on why automation jobs did not execute. I also provided links for users to clearly identify what triggered the job and what operations occurred.</p>
