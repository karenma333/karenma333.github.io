                    <h5>Role/Tools</h5>
                    <p>This was my design solution to KCPB's design challenge. I explored the Airbnb platform and then corroborated the issues I had with complaints on forums.  <br> <b>Tools:</b> Adobe XD, Secondary Research</p>
                    <h5> Problem</h5>
                    <p>
                    After playing around with Airbnb’s search process, I noticed a lack of flexibility when it comes to trying to book an Airbnb if you do not know the dates you are traveling. I did an experimental search without putting in dates and found an initial rental which was set at $19/night.
                    After clicking in to view the cottage more specifically, I chose some dates and found the price changed to $149/ night. I tried a few other dates, getting $39/night and then the original $19/night rate. This is a result of dynamic pricing on the part of the owner. Their normal price was $149/night but for a last minute booking (jan 31st), they lowered the price to $19/night and to fill in a vacancy between two other bookings, they had a lowered price of $39/night. This difference in pricing made me feel like I was tricked into looking at this listing. Only one night was $19/night. Furthermore, I can not tell what the price of each night is. In this case, the nightly prices vary by over $100 dollars. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Solution</h5>
                    <p> To solve these two problems, I started by creating more filtering options involving dates. 

                    First, I added an extra filter for Check-In/Check-Out dates. For users who pretty much had set dates already, but still were willing to be flexible, users could increase the range of their searches to be plus or minus 2 days before planned dates. 
                    The second option would be to search using a date range. In long-term planning for vacations, such as summer vacations where you have a lengthy date range, you could highlight the entire date range you are available and then input the length of your vacation you wanted. This is ideal for super flexible travel planners. This would be useful for people driving to a destination where the main constraint time wise is which stay would be available when. 

                    By changing the way users can filter dates, users now had the flexibility they didn’t have before. 

                    Moving onto the confusions with cost pricings, I looked to improve the individual listing calendars. I added the individual prices of each night onto the calendar. This might not be feasible depending on how Airbnb’s dynamic/smart pricing actually works. I also colored in the prices to be A11y Babu if they were in the originally specified price range during the search. This lets users be aware which dates are actually within their budget. 

                    </p>
                    <h5>Challenges</h5>
                    <p> Among the challenges we faced in this project, our decision to pivot, while critical to our solution, also meant we had do follow up interviews to delve in the direction we wanted to since our original interviews were insufficient. In addition, testing our prototype was difficult because we were giving our users imaginary trip prompts. People were not as invested as they would've been had it been a real trip. In addition, real trip planning is time intensive and it is possible people did not put in that amount of time for prototype testing.

                       <p>After playing around with the website myself, I did some secondary research to see if my problems are reflected by other users on the internet. From searches on AirBnB’s forum, I learned a few key problems:
If you had set dates, you might miss bookings that are only off by a few days.
While booking a stay, you view the current price and not the price of your intended stay.

Combining this with my own experiences on Airbnb, I formed a series of questions to interview a few users of Airbnb in person. The focus of my questions surrounded flexibility of Airbnb, their willingness to change their dates for price changes and any difficulties with pricing they encountered. From this, I learned that users are willing to change dates for price differences and right now, their process for looking through Airbnb for different dates was to manually change the dates to see what was available.

From my research, I felt like there were two distinct problems that existed. One, there didn’t exist flexible ways to search Airbnb if you did not have set dates in mind. Two, the costs advertised were not always accurate, leading to inconsistencies and complaints from users.</p>
