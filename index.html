						<h1>Karen Ma</h1>							
						<h2>Director, Head of UX @ <a href="https://www.singlestore.com" target="_blank" > SingleStore</a>
						</h2>
			</div>
			<div class= "proj">
				<h2>Selected Highlights</h2>
				<div class="project">
					<div class= "projBlurbs">
						<h3>Culture Building @ SingleStore (2025)</h3>
						<p> I introduced new working models, such as paired designing, moonshot workshops, and team sprints to encourage team bonding across a global team, reduce information silo-ing and keep things fresh. I defined core design principles and introduced recurring UX audits to create a consistent design culture and uplift our design quality.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="project">
					<div class= "projBlurbs">
						<h3>Strategic Leadership @ SingleStore (2025)</h3>
						<p>I revised the planning process and standardized a UI rollout strategy to provide stability for designers and more transparency across the engineering and product roadmaps. I set up cross-functional relationships to embed design across the product and sales lifecycle and evangelize the design function.</p>						
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="project">
					<div class= "projBlurbs">
						<h3>Product-led Growth @ SingleStore (2025)</h3>					
						<p>I worked with our growth PM and VP of Product, to provide a new self-service product-led growth motion. I led a team of designers to revise the end-to-end flow, including documentation site revisions, the sign up and onboarding experience, and touchpoints for converting customers to upgrade their usage.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="project">
					<div class= "projBlurbs">
						<h3>Navigation Refresh (2024)</h3>
						<p> After observing the user interface was getting overcrowded, I initiated a project to revise the navigation on the platform. I created a new object hierarchy to better align to our customers' mental models and scale with our growing feature set.</p>	
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="project">
					<div class= "projBlurbs">
						<h3>Developer Experience @ SingleStore (2024)</h3>					
						<p>I led the design for the Developer Experience, a 0->1 initiative to create a platform that allowed users to develop, deploy and manage everything from SQL scripts to dashboards to LLMs.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="project">
					<div class= "projBlurbs">
						<h3>Role-based Access Controls (2023)</h3>					
						<p>I set up the foundation for Role-based Access Control, allowing us to provide stronger security for customer data. Access controls affect every part of the platform, limiting what actions users have permission to perform.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="project">
					<div class= "projBlurbs">
					<h3>Automations Rule Builder (2022)</h3>
						<p>Automations is a rule builder that allows users to automate parts of their work. I joined as the squad’s first product designer and defined our product vision – to make Automations easier to use and more trustworthy. </p>													
					</div>
	        	</div>
				<div class="project">
					<div class= "projBlurbs">
						<h3>Risk Quantification (2022)</h3>					
						<p>Risk Quantification is a product differentiator to shift users from using LogicGate as a repository of audits to include us as defining their risk strategy. I led the beta run of the new product.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="project">
					<div class= "projBlurbs">
						<h3>Design System Contributions (2021)</h3>
						<p>I contributed to several internal design systems by auditing existing components for consistency, as well as creating and documenting new components. I created guidelines for content strategy, such as error messages, help text and empty states.  </p>						
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="project">
					<div class= "projBlurbs">
						<h3>Self-service Retirement Wizard (2020)</h3>
						<p>Following a pivot in product strategy from financial advisors to the everyday user, I worked to reframe our existing product for a more novice user base, including a simplified onboarding flow and educational dashboard experience. </p>

		<div class="about">
			<h2> More </h2>
			<p>I started my career in product design because of my interest in Cognitive Science; I loved the interaction between the behavioral research and analytics and the technical applications of the field. In my career, I’ve worked at multiple growth-stage startups, as an early design member, setting the stage for the design culture. My specialty has been bringing a pragmatic execution to complex problem spaces, including databases, risk management, and financial investment.</p><br>

			<p>Work keeps me engaged when I have flexibility to zoom in and out, working on product and process. I enjoy defining high-level product vision and strategy as well as taking a magnifying glass to the finer details of what we’ve shipped. I've found it is important to me to define processes and explore ways to improve team workflow where I can. I believe product design needs to work well with all departments and I love to be in an environment where I can embed cross functionally. </p><br>
			<p>Outside of work, I also mentor on <a href ="https://www.get-merit.com/p/karen-ma" target = "_blank">Merit</a>. I irregularly keep up with the industry via podcasts ( <a href ="https://www.20k.org/" target = "_blank">Twenty Thousand Hertz</a> ) and other literature ( <a href ="https://www.kylechayka.com/filterworld" target = "_blank">Filterworld</a> ). With so much of our work being intangible, I like to dabble in a variety of physical crafts, such as soldering keebs, wheel-throwing ceramics, metalsmithing and textile arts.</p><br>
