                            <p>UCPool is a mobile web application designed to help people find rides to the events they're interested in. Users would log in via Facebook since Facebook seemed to be the way most people found events to go to. To provide a level of safety, we limited our audience to UCSD students and required email verification. Once they enter our application, they can click on an event and offer or request a ride to an event. Then based on the desired address and their Facebook friends/interests, we would match riders and drivers with the aim of not just providing them with a ride to an event but also a new friend to enjoy the event with.<br/><br/>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>After some initial needfinding interviews, we realized that while a lot of people show interest in events, when the day of the event comes, people don't want to go. This is due to a few main factors: lack of transportation, social anxiety of not knowing anyone there, and lack of will to resolve these issues by themselves. <br/><br/>

                            From here, we concluded that we wanted to create a ridesharing application that is centered around eventgoing. 
                            Given the time constraints of the course, we drew out a brief mapping of all the screens we deemed necessary before going straight into development.<br/><br/>

                            Part way through development, we realized we weren't sure how people would respond to certain features we wanted to implement. For example, our original design showed just an event name and basic details such as location and time. We did not know if users would want to be able to go back to the event on Facebook and see things like the description, which friends were interested,etc. So, we used A/B testing and advertised our application on Facebook to see where users were clicking. <br/> <br/>
