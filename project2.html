                            <p>For many college students, budget is the limiting factor for everything when it comes to traveling (flights, hotels, etc.). Students in particular don’t really have a disposable income, so their budget is smaller and becomes a real obstacle to traveling. We chose to focus travel budgeting as our design problem after a series of need-finding interviews and secondary research to define our need.</p>

                            <p>UCPool is a mobile web application designed to help people find rides to the events they're interested in. Users would log in via Facebook since Facebook seemed to be the way most people found events to go to. To provide a level of safety, we limited our audience to UCSD students and required email verification. Once they enter our application, they can click on an event and offer or request a ride to an event. Then based on the desired address and their Facebook friends/interests, we would match riders and drivers with the aim of not just providing them with a ride to an event but also a new friend to enjoy the event with.<br/><br/>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>We started out looking at travel planning for college students as our design opportunity. With this in mind, we went through a series of 7 need-finding interviews each, ( a total of 28) where we hoped to learn more about travel planning as an overall process and find out where people encountered problems. After these interviews, we aggregated our data and created an affinity diagram. Our affinity diagram led us to realize that there were a lot of problems we could tackle within travel planning and that we should narrow down our problem space. <br/><br/>

                            Looking at our affinity diagram, we noticed that one of the biggest categories in terms of frustrations was the actual booking process and the number of tools they had to use. In our interviews, we noted that while planning their trips, people often had many tabs open since there were so many aspects involved in  travel planning, such as booking a flight and hotel, renting a car, and creating an itinerary. As a result, we narrowed down our problem space to travel planning structure. 

                            We went through a second round of interviews to look at specifically how people planned. We wanted to know what was the reason why travel planning was complicated. Why did travel planning necessitate the usage of an abundance of different tools and was there any way we could improve how people planned their trips.  We wanted to see what items they prioritized and why. 

                            When we looked at our research again, we realized that we had misinterpreted our data. The complicated nature of travel planning was not the problem we were looking for. Rather, it was a symptom that resulted from trying to travel plan with a budget. We redefined our problem space once again to travel budgeting.

                            We sent out a survey via Facebook to gather some quantitative data on the current status of student travel budgeting. From our results, over 50% of students claimed to budget. However, when we compared this to our interview data, it was clear that what they said they did and what they actually did was very different. Our interview data showed us that people explicitly mentioned trying to cut costs by budgeting for flight and hotel but often did not go much farther than that. When pressed about budgeting, their responses in person were more often a “kinda” rather than a strong affirmative “yes”.

                            Millennials want to travel. In fact, they are quickly rising to be the second-highest spending generation group on travel ( Millennial Travel Spending). Millennials are projected to take over 320 million trips by 2020. However, this desire to travel is affected by the lack of finances available. Travel is often complicated by their lack of savings,  “over 50% of millennials have less than $1,000 in savings” (Majority of Millennials). TripAdvisor’s TripBarometer notes that 31% of millennials are reducing their travel budgets as a result of financial constraints (Trip Barometer).  Finances are the constraining factor in travel planning for the college student demographic. Looking at the travel subreddit on reddit.com, searching for the term budget leads to multiple posts by college-aged students and newly graduated young adults posting up questions such as “I have $1500 to visit New York. Is my budget reasonable?”. These posts are reflective of the inability of students to budget. Therein lies our problem space.

                            Part way through development, we realized we weren't sure how people would respond to certain features we wanted to implement. For example, our original design showed just an event name and basic details such as location and time. We did not know if users would want to be able to go back to the event on Facebook and see things like the description, which friends were interested,etc. So, we used A/B testing and advertised our application on Facebook to see where users were clicking. <br/> <br/>
