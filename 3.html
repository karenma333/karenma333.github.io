								<p>This project started with an examination of the travel planning process. User research candidates were sourced with a variety of travel habits from frequent international travelers to group roadtrippers. These candidates were asked to step through their standard travel planning process while thinking out loud as we observed.</p>

								<p>From here, we started ideating on ways we could solve this problem and created two solutions we felt were strongest. Using paper prototypes, I walked some users through a wizard-of-oz scenario to see how our solution could fit into their existing travel planning process. As users were on a computer looking up bookings, the paper prototypes were updated to reflect their situation. Users were requested to start by stating their travel budget and directed more to plan with their budget in mind.</p>

								<p>The final solution focused on providing a place for users to consolidate their travel options and compare the impact on their budgets. Users started out with some general travel information allowing us to provide them with a sample breakdown of their budget as well as a target budget based on the cost of other traveler&#x27;s trips. This gave users an idea of how much each part of the trip should cost and whether or not their original budget was in the correct ballpark. Users then could add in the travel options they were considering to compare the impact to their budget. </p>
