							<h4>Context</h4>
							<div>
								<div>
									<p>Especially when it comes to SaaS, the more embedded your product is into the users’ workflow, the less likely your customers will go through the effort of changing vendors. For this project, I worked with a product manager to explore ways we could increase stickiness through added convenience. We ended up with a Microsoft365 integration and a RiskCloud Documents offering. </p>

							<h4>Through generative research, we learned that our users had a strong reliance on Excel and Word and were frequently downloading and re-uploading versioned files through their day. By providing a Microsoft integration, users could now edit their files in-app, decreasing friction in their workflow.,Sometimes, users were repeating the information within the platform into a separate local file, for reporting purposes, doubling their workload. With our Documents offering, we provided users with an easy way to export into their format of choice. Now, users could do more of their work within our application.</h4>

					<p>I started my career in product design because of my interest in Cognitive Science; I loved the interaction between the behavioral research and analytics and the technical applications of the field. Now, work keeps my engaged when I get to spend time discussing product strategy and product vision, writing new guidelines for design systems and growing design culture. Outside of work,I also mentor on <a href ="https://www.get-merit.com/p/karen-ma" target = "_blank">Merit </a>
					<p>In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with all sorts of hands on crafts — currently lost wax casting. I'm currently thinking about <a href = "https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-poison-squad-one-chemist-s-single-minded-crusade-for-food-safety-at-the-turn-of-the-twentieth-century-deborah-blum/586737" target="_blank"> The Poison Squad</a>.</p>
