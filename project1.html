                            <p>Tasked with finding a problem space that could fuel a start-up idea, we chose to look at traveling. Looking at the design space of travel, we focused on the problem of itinerary planning. While there are many ways for people to find things to do on their trips, there arenâ€™t many ways to figure out the logistics of the trip as a whole. </p>

                            <p>Our final solution is a travel itinerary amalgamator. Users can look up places on our desktop website and add them to our itinerary or start with a pre-made template. After adding places to our website, Tripsy lets the user know the best day and time to place the new point of interest. This would be based on the best time to go to the place (ie. beach at sunset) as well as which day it fits in logically (ie. user is already nearby). <br/><br/>

                            After creating an itinerary on the desktop, the user can open up Tripsy on their phone as a mobile application. This way, the user can follow their itinerary as they are traveling. Given that plans always change, Tripsy also has a mobile spontaneity feature where you can use the application to find things to do nearby. This can range from needing to find a nearby public bathroom to needing a place to go for lunch. <br /><br/>

                            In terms of group functionality, users can share their plans with others and collaborate to plan together through upvoting itinerary changes to show agreement as well as adding their own suggestions. <br/><br/>

                            With Tripsy, we sought to maximize travelers' experiences by improving their itinerary through suggestions and route planning. We wanted to not only make itinerary creation easier, we also wanted to improve their experience on the go. By bundling itinerary viewing, spontaneous decision-making and map guidance into one, we hoped to alleviate some of the traveling stress. <br/>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Initially, we conducted some interviews to see what problems frequent travelers encountered. After narrowing down to 5 major problems surrounding traveling, we began by sending out an online survey of problem scenarios that we thought people ran into while traveling. This allowed us to confirm the finding of our interviews on a larger quantitative scale. <br/><br/>

                            We narrowed down to five major problems:<br/>
                            -People want to make sure they are making the best use of their time.<br/>
                            -People want to do local/authentic things while traveling.<br/>
                            -People post pictures to social media about travel, needing photo spots.<br/>
                            -People find it hard to coordinate and plan travel for groups.<br/>
                            -People don't know what the foreign equivalents of rating websites such as Yelp are.<br/><br/>

                            Looking not only at the design problem that seemed most prevalent, as well as the monetary/business interest of the idea, we decided to create an improved itinerary planner. After observing the current solutions out there, we concluded that there are plenty of ways out there for people to find things to do on travels. However, what is missing is how to fit in everything people want to do as well as what the best way to see everything is. The logistics are the hard part. Observing the tools people actually used, as well as lesser known solutions out there, we picked out the key features that would be desirable. <br/><br/>

                            In our solution, we wanted people to be able to group plan effectively, get recommendations as they're following their itinerary, and know about scenic routes and photo opportunities.<br/><br/>

                            We began with paper prototypes and used Wizard of Oz to test out what type of features they would use and interviewed/tested with people in the process of planning out their own trips. At the same time, we finalized two branding alternatives and used A/B testing to observe audience engagement. Using the insights we gleaned, we came up with our final prototype.</p>
