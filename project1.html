                            <p>Our final solution was an travel itinerary amalgamator. Users can look up places on our desktop website and add them to our itinerary or start with a pre-made template. After adding places to our website, Tripsy would let the user know the best day and time to place the new point of interest. This would be based on the best time to go to the place as well as which day it fits in logically to take advantage of the amount of time the user has. 
                            Now, the user can open up Tripsy on their phone as a mobile application. This way, the user can follow their itinerary on the go. Given that plans always change, Tripsy has a mobile spontaneity feature where you can use the paplication to find things to do nearby. This can range from needing to find a nearby public bathroom to needing a place to go for lunch. 

                            In terms of group functionality, users can share their plans with others and collaborate to plan together through upvoting itinerary changes to show agreement as well as adding their own suggestions. </p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Initially, we conducted some interviews to see what problems frequent travelers encountered. After narrowing down to 5 major problems surrounding traveling, we began by sending out an online survey of problem scenarios that we thought people ran into while traveling. This allowed us to confirm the finding of our interviews on a larger quantitative scale. 

                            The five problems we looked at were:
                            -Time maximizing
                            -Local things to do
                            -Photo spots
                            -Group planning is hard
                            -Yelp isn’t worldwide

                            Looking not only at the design problem that seemed most prevalent, as well as the monetary/business interest of the idea, we decided to create an improved itinerary planner. After observing the current solutions out there, we concluded that there are plenty of ways out there for people to find things to do on travels. However, what is missing is how to fit in everything people want to do as well as what the best way to see everything is. The logistics are the hard part. Observing the tools people actually used, as well as lesser known solutions out there, we picked out the key features that would be desirable. 

                            In our solution, we wanted people
                            -group plan (one person plans, other do a little bit of planning)
                            -happiest route
                            -on the go recommendations
                            -notes/wishlist
                            -scenic route/photo ops

                            We began with paper prototypes and wizard of oz to test out what type of features they would use and interviewed/tested with people in the process of planning out their own trips.
