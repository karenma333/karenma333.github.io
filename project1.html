                            <p>When you plan a vacation, you have to book a flight, somewhere to stay, things to do and places to eat while there, and then you have to double check with your travel buddies to make sure everyone is on the same page. For the most part, there are solutions for all of these separate parts of traveling. From Google Flights, to Expedia, to Tripadvisor and Zomato, we can compare and review every aspect of travel planning. But when it comes to putting it all together and creating an itinerary to follow, what do you use? 

                            For our Interaction Design Start Up studio course, we looked at ways to improve travel planning by creating an improved method of itinerary planning as a team of four.
                            </p>

               <section class="Final Solution section">
                    <div class="section-inner">
                        <h2 class="heading">Solution</h2>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Our final solution, Tripsy, consists of a desktop website supplemented with a mobile application. A map-based itinerary creator, Tripsy not only allows the user to visualize where each attraction will be but also will suggest the logical place it fits into the itinerary (ie. if you will already be nearby)<br/><br/>

                            The traveler would first plan their trip on the desktop by finding things to do either on the Tripsy platform or by other means, such as suggestions from friends, or via internet search. Then, they would input their list of interested locations onto the Tripsy website. Tripsy would provide time estimates and suggest what order to do things in. Then, the user can now view their itinerary on the mobile application.<br /><br/>

                            The aim of the mobile application is to make following an itinerary on-the-go easier. As they follow their own created itinerary, they can also use our “Explore Nearby” function for any last minute changes. What if the museum is less interesting to them than anticipated? The traveler can explore and find things to do nearby. They will be able to filter their suggestions based on types of activities. These suggestions are shown to them as overlapping cards. This is a design decision based on the thought that when given too many options, it can be difficult to make a decision. This is time wasted on trips trying to accommodate everyone. By presenting less options at a time, there is more incentive to choose the first one that is appealing. <br/><br/>

                            There is also a map version of the “Explore Nearby” cards. This allows the user to see more options at once and can be useful for sudden needs for a restroom, wifi spot, or atm, where distance is the factor that matters most.<br/><br/>
                            In addition, Tripsy also provides the user with a navigation system that takes into account “the route to happiness”. Inspired by a Ted Talk, “The shortest paths to happiness. Literally“, we envisioned Tripsy providing routes to users that is not only an efficient path to their destination but also one that is scenic and provides the traveler with an opportunity to explore the city.<br/><br/>
                            With Tripsy, we hope to fill a gap in the travel planning sphere. We recognize that there are a plethora of ways for travelers to find things to do but when it comes to planning, they are often left to use Google Docs or Google Maps. Tripsy hopes to serve as their go to itinerary creator by making itinerary creation before the trip as well as itinerary following on the trip easy. <br/> <br/>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Amongst our team, we found that we all used Google Docs/Google Maps to list out the places we wanted to visit when traveling. Google Docs let us make notes about each place, such as what famous food a restaurant might be known for, or what time is best to go see an attraction. On the other hand, Google Maps let you see how far/close places were to each other and to your current location. This allows the traveler to plan a route for the day. However, we felt like there had to be a better way to make itineraries. So, we conducted a series of interviews of travelers, both once-a-year travelers as well as travel bloggers. This allowed us to form personas for the type of travelers we wanted to target as well as allowed us to create a survey about the problems we noticed to get data validation on a larger quantitative scale. <br/><br/>

                            We noticed three general types of travelers:<br/>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Traveler A: </span>Created a schedule before departing and follows the schedule to a T with pre-determined time estimates. <br/>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Traveler B: </span> Creates a loose list of things and plans for the trip but is willing to be sidetracked by unexpected finds.<br/>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Traveler C:</span> Very “go with the flow” and more willing to just focus on “exploring the city”<br/><br/>

                            Looking at other itinerary creation applications, the main competitor we found was Sygic, a map based itinerary creator which also helped users pick the most efficient route to maximize time at attractions. However, we felt like the lack of traveler familiarity with the application meant we could make a viable alternative that is more appealing. <br/><br/>

                <section class="Prototypes section">
                    <div class="section-inner">
                        <h2 class="heading">Ideation, Prototypes, and User Testing</h2>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Based on our initial idea to improve itinerary planning, we created paper prototypes and used Wizard of Oz to test out our idea with people we knew were in the process of planning trips for the summer.  We also created two branding options and bought ads on Google to see if our product would generate visuals/clicks by people searching on the internet. Our two branding alternatives were not only visually different but also tried to appeal to a different type of persona. This way we could also see if we needed to gear our product towards a particular audience. <br/><br/>

                            From this, we learned that we did get clicks on our ads but the conversion rates (email sign ups) were the same for both branding options. This affirmed our belief that our product would not be specialized for its audience. We also found that even when using a product designed to show you the cheapest flights, hotels, best food, etc, people would still double check on other websites. As a result, there is a refusal to just check Expedia or just check Google Flights. We also noticed that websites that aimed to simplify steps for users by having flights, hotels, and car rentals at the same site did not affect user behavior. This led us to believe that with the internet at our fingertips, users are unwilling to trust one website or one application to do everything for them and would rather just put in some extra time themselves. <br/><br/>

                            In line with our needfinding interviews, our testers said they used Google Docs and felt like having an itinerary that was just on a map would not be enough because Google Docs allows them to take notes. This led us to deciding to allow users to add notes to each destination. In addition, one user noted that just because he looks up a lot of things doesn’t mean he intends to do all them of. This led us to consider how to note points of interests without having them on the explicit itinerary. We accomplished this by having a separate category to list all points of interest that users don’t want to be set into an itinerary. <br/><br/>
                            While discussing these features, another user brought up the need for offline maps since wifi is not always readily available and when traveling internationally, data can be expensive to use. From this comment, we realized that traveling, especially internationally, leads to a lot of small inconveniences. This became a main focus of our application. We wanted to have it easier for users to find bathrooms, public transit, and wifi hotspots. We also realized that many of the websites we rely on, such as Yelp for restaurants, are not international. We decided to tackle this by automatically using the local version of Yelp to provide food. For example, when going to Hong Kong, restaurants tend to be rated by Open Rice and in New Zealand, Zomato is more popular than yelp.<br/><br/>
                            One of the last insights we came up with was photo spots. As we were thinking of features, we considered the importance of photography while traveling. So, as we went through our paper prototypes we showed users this feature and questioned their social media habits. Essentially, with the rise of social media, often the photos taken while traveling are just as important as the experiences. As is such, we decided to give photo spot recommendations in the application as well as consider how photogenic our navigation routes are. For example, if a route is a minute longer but passes by a series of murals, it would be more desirable. <br/><br/>
