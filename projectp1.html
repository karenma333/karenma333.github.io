                    <h5>Role/Tools</h5>
                    <p>This has been a solo endeavor by myself to create my own portfolio<br> <b>Tools:</b>Google Analytics, User Testing, HTML/CSS, Javascript, MaterializeCSS Framework</p>
                    <h5> Problem</h5>
                    <p>All User Experience Designers need portfolios. After experimenting with website builders such as Wix and Wordpress, I decided to try and build my own since I did not want to be restricted by the design decisions of the premade templates. I started off by finding a template online and modifying the layout to fit my own preferences. My desire to improve my front-end development skills led me to decide to ultimately create one from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Solution</h5>
                    <p> The portfolio you are currently viewing is created with HTML/CSS with a Materialize CSS Framework and Javascript. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Challenges</h5>
                    <p> Among the challenges I faced is finding out what format would appeal best to my users and learning how to quantify my success with data. My data may be skewed by my own time spent on my website which I have now altered to exclude my IP address from future datasets. In addition, the time period and subsequent data for my current portfolio iteration is significantly decreased compared to my previous iteration, making it more difficult to see patterns. </p>

                <b>Previous iterations of portfolio website</b>
                <div class="slider">

                    <ul class="slides">
                        <li><img src="assets/images/website/website1.png"></li>
                        <li><img src="assets/images/website/website2.png"></li>
                        <li><img src="assets/images/website/website3.png"></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                        
            </div> 

            <div class="Process section card-panel">
                <h4 >Process</h4>
                <div class="content">
                    <h5>First Iteration</h5>
                    <p>My initial layout showcased my projects on my homepage with short blurbs introducing this project and had a project navigation system where you could either click back to home and find a specific project or traverse all my projects via next and previous buttons. The rationale behind this was so that recruiters looking through my website could see which projects piqued their interest. However, this also forced users to scroll down and skim every single project regardless of whether or not it was relevant. This is important because my projects cover a wide variety of disciplines.</p>
                    <h5>Second Iteration </h5>
                    <p>For my second iteration, I wanted to keep the idea of having project blurbs so that people visiting my website could see a description of each project before having to click through to a project. To view each project, I included navigation links in the footer as well as the option to click back to main projects page to see all project blurbs again. I also separated my projects into design and code but quickly realized I couldn’t fully separate the projects into the two disciplines. I tested this version with my peers and user feedback felt that the lack of images made my portfolio visually unappealing. I wanted to control the projects that users would see first and so decided to make my home page the project I felt showcased my skills best. Watching my testers use my site, they disregarded my home page project and clicked on the projects they wanted to see anyway. Since my Google Analytics data shows actual recruiters using my website, I heavily relied on it to make the current iteration of my website. At the time, I was only recording overall visits and visits to each page. I noticed a disproportionate number of users clicking onto the home page after a projects page. This led me to conclude that users weren’t using my navigation links in the footer since they were heading back to my home page to navigate my projects. From this, I went onto my third iteration. </p>
                        <b>Data from Google Analytics</b>
                        <div class="slider">

                            <ul class="slides">
                                <li><img src="assets/images/website/audienceOverviewBefore.png"></li>
                                <li><img src="assets/images/website/audienceOverviewAfter.png"></li>
                                <li><img src="assets/images/website/pageVisitsBefore.png"></li>
                                <li><img src="assets/images/website/pageVisitsAfter.png"></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                                
                    <h5>Final Iteration</h5>
                    <p>For my final iteration, I concluded that my portfolio has two key audiences: recruiters and designers. <br>
                        <b>Recruiters: Important to make a good first impression in order to be considered for a role. Might expect visual appeal because of designer roles</b> </br>
                        <b>Designers: Need to showcase my work flow and show that I know what I am doing. Might be interested in the indepth process and research and also UI skills </b> </br>
                    I decided to examine other ux designer portfolios and imitate the same style with image based project buttons opening into project case studies and an initial home page with my image and a short blurb about myself. To allow users to know which projects are relevant to the job I am applying to, they can sort by tags to see which projects I like the most as well as which ones might show the skills they are looking for. </p>
                    <h5>Personas</h5>
                    <p>We noticed three general types of travelers:<br/>
                    In comparing my Google Analytics data for the previous version and this current version, my bounce rate has decreased from 30% to 11% and the projects that users are most likely to view has changed from Travel Budgeting which was initial the first project on display to my Airbnb Feature redesign. My average session duration has changed from 2 minutes to almost 4 minutes. </p>
