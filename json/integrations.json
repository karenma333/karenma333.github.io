				"Paragraph":"Emails are the primary form of notification; users rely on emails to inform them of any work they have been assigned and any revisions necessary. However, the existing emails were causing user fatigue since in extreme cases, one user might get 200+ emails at one time. By collating these notifications into one email, users would be more inclined to read emails and enjoy a less cluttered inbox.",

				"Paragraph":"While many GRC software options exist in the market, final deliverables are oftentimes still presented in the form of excel spreadsheets, word documents and PDFs. Rather than force users to adopt a software only approach, we integrated with Microsoft and Formstack. Users can now preview attachments in-app and make edits without having to download and re-upload documents. Instead of manually transfering information from RiskCloud to a document, users can export data with their own customized document template.",

				{"Subtitle":"Webhooks", 
				"Paragraph":"Accommodating every integration our users want is not feasible. So, in addition to API access, we also added webhook support. Users can build their own automation based on key event triggers in RiskCloud.",

				"Paragraph":"Integrations consider the touchpoints of our users outside of our platform to provide a holistic perspective on the users' experience with RiskCloud. By increasing the ease of which RiskCloud fits into our users' existing processes, users do not feel the friction of adopting a new tool. We also achieve an increased stickiness by having out-of-the-box integrations with their existing tools."}]
