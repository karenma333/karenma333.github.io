			"details":["Especially when it comes to SaaS, the more embedded your product is into the usersâ€™ workflow, the less likely your customers will go through the effort of changing vendors. For this project, I worked with a product manager to explore ways we could increase stickiness through added convenience. We ended up with a Microsoft365 integration and a RiskCloud Documents offering."]

By providing a Microsoft integration, users could now edit their files in-app, decreasing friction in their workflow.","Sometimes, users were repeating the information within the platform into a separate local file, for reporting purposes, doubling their workload. With our Documents offering, we provided users with an easy way to export into their format of choice. Now, users could do more of their work within our application."]
