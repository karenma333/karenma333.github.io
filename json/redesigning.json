			"Paragraph":"I worked with two other UX designers on this 10 month project. I focused on leading design critiques and review sessions with internal stakeholders, working across teams to determine the scope of the MVP release and owning some of the specific designs of the overall redesign.",

			"Title":"Key Use Cases",

			{
			"Title":"Our modelling of projections did not match users' mental model.",
			"icon":"brain_icon.png",
			"Paragraph":"Our initial display used a tabbing format to allow users to compare different scenarios. However, we saw user confusion. They did not understand why the values are changing and why not all of the values changed. "
			},
			{"Title":"The application load time was not proportional to payoff for users.",
			"icon":"loading_icon.png",
			"Paragraph":"In areas where our application takes a long time to load, users were dropping off. It was clear we needed to decrease the load time as well as improve our loading pattterns."
			},
			{"Title":"The primary dashboard was too cluttered",
			"icon":"clutter_icon.png",
			"Paragraph":"Because the existing visual hierarchy of the dashboard had many items on the same level, there was no clear indicator as to what users should be paying the most attention to. There was no differentiation between items that were prone to change and items that are seldom accessed. "

			{"Title":"Design Highlights",
			"Paragraph":"While there were many things we wanted to change in the new application, our key use cases allowed us to hone in on what we would be solving for in this launch. Not only did we make changes for this application, we also developed design system guidelines from these solutions. "

			"Subtitle":"Improved content through consistency",
			"icon":"key_icon.png",
			"Paragraph":"A content review was undertaken,  reviewing the copy, such as help text and info buttons, leading to standardized key terminology to reduce the vocabulary on the page.  Additionally, rules for displays of numbers were put in place, allowing for consistent expecatations of rounding and precision."
			},
			{
			"Subtitle":"Engaged loading times",
			"icon":"loading2_icon.png",
			"Paragraph":"Taking notes from gaming loading screens, the existing loading screens were replaced with loading screens that gave users something to look at while they waited. Additionally, instead of constant loading, information was loaded on an as-needed basis."
			},
			{
			"Subtitle":"User controlled saving mechanisms",
			"icon":"control_icon.png",
			"Paragraph":"Previously, all changes were saved on blur, as soon as users clicked out of a editable box. This ensured information was always as up-to-date as possible but wasted a lot of time. Updates were made so the save behavior only occurred when a user clicks a save button, allowing users more freedom to interact without having their user flow interrupted by loading time."
			},
			{
			"Subtitle":"Side-by-side comparisons",
			"icon":"compare_icon.png",			
			"Paragraph":"In the previous tabbing style, the two scenarios could not be seen side-by-side; users would need to memorize the differences themselves. By placing the two scenarios on the same page, users were better able to draw their own conclusions to pros and cons.",

			},
			{
			"Title":"Conclusion",
			"Paragraph":"Given the timeline of the project, the primary focus for the first launch was to build a good foundation by setting up design patterns to follow when iterating on the application.  Not only does this new redesign make use of our new visual design library, it also puts into place user experience guidelines from content strategy to interaction design patterns."
