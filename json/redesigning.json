			"Subtitle":"Our modelling of projections did not match users' mental model.",
			"icon":"brain_icon.png",
			"Paragraph":"Our initial display used a tabbing format to allow users to compare different scenarios. However, we saw user confusion. They did not understand why the values are changing and why not all of the values changed. "

			{"Subtitle":"The primary dashboard was too cluttered",
			"icon":"clutter_icon.png",
			"Paragraph":"Because the existing visual hierarchy of the dashboard had many items on the same level, there was no clear indicator as to what users should be paying the most attention to. There was no differentiation between items that were prone to change and items that are seldom accessed. "

			"Subtitle":"Improved content through consistency",
			"icon":"key_icon.png",
			"Paragraph":"A content review was undertaken,  reviewing the copy, such as help text and info buttons, leading to standardized key terminology to reduce the vocabulary on the page.  Additionally, rules for displays of numbers were put in place, allowing for consistent expecatations of rounding and precision."

			"Subtitle":"Engaged loading times",
			"icon":"loading2_icon.png",

			{
			"Subtitle":"Side-by-side comparisons",
			"icon":"compare_icon.png",			
			"Paragraph":"In the previous tabbing style, the two scenarios could not be seen side-by-side; users would need to memorize the differences themselves. By placing the two scenarios on the same page, users were better able to draw their own conclusions to pros and cons.",

			"Title":"Conclusion",
			"Paragraph":" Not only does this new redesign make use of our new visual design library, it also puts into place user experience guidelines from content strategy to interaction design patterns. The simplified experience also provided a stronger case for our product's value add, leading to increased sales."
