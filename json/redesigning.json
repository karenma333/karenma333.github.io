			"Subtitle":"The way projections were modelled did not match users' mental model.",

			"icon":"control_icon.png",
			"Paragraph":"Previously, all changes were saved on blur, as soon as users clicked out of a editable box. This ensured information was always as up-to-date as possible but wasted a lot of time. Updates were made so the save behavior only occurred when a user clicks a save button, allowing users more freedom to interact without having their user flow interrupted by loading time."
