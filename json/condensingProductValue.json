			{"type":"splash",
				"Title":"Product Opportunity",
			"Paragraph":"To better allow less financially-educated users to understand advice from an online finance product, I piloted a feature to allow users to receive a snapshot of their advice to reference in posterity and review with others."
			},
			{
			"Title":"The Current State",
			"Paragraph":"Because I was not starting from scratch, I started out by conducting a heuristic evaluation on the existing state of the solution - a 5 page document summarizing the user's advice and recommendations. "
			},
			{
				"Subtitle":"Terminology used was unfamiliar to audiences or not industry-standard",
				"icon":"confused.png",
				"Paragraph":"The same concepts were referred to with different words in the same document."
			},
			{
				"Subtitle":"Information lacked consistency in formatting",
				"icon":"documents.png",
				"Paragraph":"The document shifted from future state to current state to previous state without clear indicators. "
			},
			{
				"Subtitle":"Relevant content was scattered",
				"icon":"clutter_icon.png",
				"Paragraph":"Detailed information that is only relevant to power users was intermixed, leading to confusion for our average user who did not need the extra detail.",
				"image":"beforeProposal.png",
				"caption":"The original advice proposal pdf document."
			},
			{"Title":"Information Architecture",
			"Paragraph":"In order to both review what content should be displayed and how, I decided to conduct a hybrid card sort. This card sort started our users with a set of the information in the current document and the current sections of the document and also allowed users to add cards/section. Users were also not required to use all the cards. "
			},
			{"Paragraph":"To delve a little further, I also asked users to highlight the most important information in each section by attempting to remove up to 10 cards from their original card sort. After conducting the card sort with 14 people, I created an information hierarchy diagram, with the darker purple cards highlighting card that 70% of our users placed in these groupings even after being asked to remove the cards. This diagram dictated the information architecture structure of the final solution.",
				"image":"informationArchitecture.png",
				"altText":"Card sort results consisted of four groupings, summary, contributions, accounts, asset allocation, with the summary including the projected retirement income and recommended retirement age."
			},
			{"Title":"User Testing",
			"Paragraph":"Using the insights from my user research, combined with technical constraints and customer feedback, we created two parallel designs.I asked users to locate information in the document to evaluate success of metaphors, and conducted 5-second tests to gain a user's first impression. I reviewed the error rates on the tasks as well as time taken to complete tasks to inform our future design iterations."},
			{
				"Subtitle":"Asset Allocation should be grouped together.",
				"icon":"table_icon.png",
				"Paragraph":"While we attempted to separate out the highest level asset allocation information to the front page for our average user, it appeared that the average user did not care and the whole concept was considered advanced."
			},
			{
				"Subtitle":"Contributions are really confusing.",
				"icon":"money_icon.png",
				"Paragraph":"Users had the highest error rates in this section, misreading what their overall contributions were, as well as their contributions per account. Our visual hierarchy was incorrect, users valued all their contribution information."
			},
			{
				"Subtitle":"Visuals are not always helpful.",
				"icon":"charts_icon.png",
				"Paragraph":"The chart visual for contributions caused more confusion than clarity."

			{
				"Subtitle":"Target is most important.",
				"icon":"target_icon.png",
				"Paragraph":"In the two visual metaphors we tested, we chose to highlight either wealth or target income as the measure of plan status. Projections of the user's retirement income provided the best understanding of how on track they were."
			},
			{
				"Subtitle":"Focus on recommendations.",
				"icon":"focus_icon.png",
				"Paragraph":"The focus of the document begins with the recommendations provided to the user, the three concrete expectations of user behavior. This acts as a summary of the document and the continuing pages provide additional details for power users who may be interested."
			},
			{
				"Subtitle":"Provide details on tangible impacts",
				"icon":"money_icon.png",
				"Paragraph":"Contributions are the only sector where users will feel an immediate impact and thus are the area that users focus on. Providing all available details here supports user curiousity.",
				"image":"afterProposal.png",
				"altText":"Finalized PDF product"
			},
			{
			"Title":"Conclusion",
			"Paragraph":"This document redesign better maps to the dashboard in the application and focuses on a snapshot of the new recommendations instead of a comparison between the current state and ideal state. The existing document was so confusing that we fielded customer service complaints from users asking for explanations. I anticipate a decrease in the customer service complaints with regards to this feature, increased usage of this feature as well as increased enrollment for users who have downloaded a document."
