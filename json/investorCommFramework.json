				"blurb":"By supplementing existing research with additional targeted surveys focused towards the way employer-sponsored retirement services communicate with users, I created three personas representative of the productâ€™s target audience. These personas needed to account for the range of investment knowledge and retirement planning prioritization levels as anyone could have a retirement account. Such a broad audience meant that I targeted designing for the extremes as a method to improve overall user accommodation.",

By mapping the three most likely user journeys, I was able to examine the touchpoints and scenarios each existing document might be viewed from. This allows me to review the way current communications are being received and highlighted potential gaps in communication.",

				{"title":"Thematic Guidelines",
				"blurb":"With each opportunity to communicate with an investor, there are three themes to leverage in determining whether or not a new communication is necessary.",
				"listPair":[
					{"1. Remind the user of the service.":" Since part of the user base is unlikely to interact frequently with our service, we need to reiterate the purpose of the service with each touchpoint."},
					{"2. Reiterate the value of the service.":" The true value of managed advice is the long term benefits. A reminder to this effect aims to dissuade hasty decisions based on short-term results."},
					{"3. Encourage interaction.":" As users stay with the service, their financial situation is subject to change. Interacting with the platform to keep information up-to-date is in the best interest of the user so that they will get improved advice."}

				{"title":"Visual Layout Guidelines",
				"blurb":"To maintain consistency across the documents an investor may receive, documents should follow the same layout for familiarity.",
				"listPair":[
					{"1. High-Level Summary":"To compensate for the length of the documents, maintaining a top-level summary on the first page highlights the informations users care about."},
					{"2. Basics One Pager": "For users who do not have strong investment knowledge, ensure that the first page of any document should be all they need to know."},
					{"3. In-Depth Details":"By maintaining the option for users to get granular details, the rest of the document serves both to educate the less familiar and answer the questions only those with a high degree of knowledge would ask."}

				"image":"LayoutGuidelines.png"
				},
				{"title":"Framework in Practice",
				"blurb":"Because the platform's own design language is still nascent, this framework is intended to be lightweight with the potential to built upon when the overall design system is more concrete. Likewise, as more document types emerge, it's likely the rigidity of this framework will also change. To see this framework in practice, check out my case study on the Advice Proposal PDF!"
