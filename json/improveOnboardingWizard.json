			"icon":"persondetails.png",
			"Paragraph":"Looking at user analytics, two-thirds of users who were interested in customization were going into their profile data but not making any changes. In addition, I learned that the data we receive isn't guaranteed to be correct. Since users were interested in understanding what profile data we had on them, the set-up process, which displays the profile data, was made to be required for all users."

			"icon":"control_icon.png",

			"Subtitle":"Establish Expected Effort",
			"icon":"hourglass.png",
			"Paragraph":"Not all the customization options provided to a user are as easy as a Yes/No. For some, users need an expected time of up to 5 minutes to complete the set up. Looking at user activity, the drop-off rates indicated that users were caught off guard. This was resolved by adding a progress indicators and language to reference expected time."

			{
			"Subtitle":"Connect the dots",
			"icon":"connectdots.png",
			"Paragraph":"Users were unable to see the benefit of their customization. By placing call to actions in the areas where they would directly see changes, users better understand the pulleys and levers available in the system."
			},
			{
			"Title":"Conclusion",
			"Paragraph":"Evaluating user behavior and separating out the required vs the optional onboarding flow allowed me to move from a nine-step wizard to a one-step wizard.The original wizard was lengthy in order to prove users with a sense of customization but failed to actually encourage customization. While the wizard solution did successfully increase conversion rates, by 50%, the next steps to investigate is how to encourage and increase customization. "
