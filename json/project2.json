		"problem":{"Problem Space":"Due to the fact that a large part of the anticipated user base is expected to infrequently interact with the applicaton, communications to the users are a crucial part of their experience with the service. However, because each investor communication, from email correspondence to generated PDFs, had been designed individually by differing designers, a user's experience would be drastically different from one piece of communication to another. I took the opportunity to take a holistic look at all possible forms of communication to build out a thematic framework and suggested design language for all investor communications to follow."},
