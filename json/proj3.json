			"Paragraph":"Less than 10% of millenials make financial decisions by themselves, often asking financial advice from others. To better allow millenials to share the financial advice from our application, I piloted a feature to allow users to receive a snapshot of their advice to reference in posterity and display with others.",

			"Title":"AFFINITY DIAGRAM",
			"Paragraph":"I took a look at the initial state of the feature to be redesigned using Nielsen's usability heuristics. Based on my evaluation, I noticed that the terminology was unfamiliar to audiences, the information lacked consistency and switched between different modes, such as between total vs singular account data. The visual was also not flexible, mixing sections that were not always applicable and too confusing for the base audience.",

The intent here was to allow users to skim the first page and receive all the information they needed. Following those pages were two pages displayed the plan recommendations.",

			"Title":"MEASURING SUCCESS",
			"Paragraph":"Measuring the success of this feature requires a  review of customer service outreach. With the current state, customers were repeatedly reaching out from confusion from the visual. Decreasing the frequency of customers reaching out would allow me to extrapolate that the new document may be easier to understand.   "
