			"summary":"Hello, I’m Karen and I’m currently working as a product designer at NextCapital. In college, I studied Cognitive Science, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction after discovering an interest in ethnographic research and its application to product development. I love working in the intersection between design, research and development! Outside of work, I spend my time exploring my new home in the city of Chicago, reading (The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test!), and trying out new recipes for mealprepping. ",
