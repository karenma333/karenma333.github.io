			{ "Title":"Solution",
			"details":["Buttons are a foundational component for design systems. They are widely used and providing guidelines for button usage gives a platform structure and consistency. After auditing our button usage across the application, I wrote guidelines on button placement, button copy, and button hierarchy.","Without a dedicated copywriter, copy was written by product managers, product designers, and front-end engineers. Inconsistencies are especially notable when it comes to error messages, empty states and guidance messaging. I facilitated a workshop to define our voice and wrote documentation for a more cohesive copywriting methodology."]
