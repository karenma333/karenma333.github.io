				"Paragraph":"After finding success in the platformâ€™s use as a retirement advice tool, our company wanted to expand to a new target audience. Previously, financial advisors (experts in the field) leveraged our platform as a tool to help users determine their best plan and investment strategy for retirement. Upon releasing the initial self-service product, usage was lower than anticipated. My work on this product updated the feature to better reflect the needs and user flow of the new target audience.",

				{"Subtitle":"Product Opportunity", 
				"Paragraph":"Based on its performance, it was clear the existing product was not a good fit for the self-service audience. Not only did we need to adapt our product to be friendlier and digestible for a more novice audience, we also needed to consider the change in the overall user journey. Users no longer had an trusted expert at hand to ask for help, meaning our product had to prove its value on its own."

			"section":[
				{"Subtitle":"Methods", 
				"Paragraph":"To gain a better understanding of our new target user base, I took a backwards look at our analytics data and reviewed existing literature about retirement planning sentiments. Then to inform our design decisions, I conducted a card sort, usability tests and A/B tested parallel designs to come to our final solution."

				{"Subtitle":"Analytics", 
				"Paragraph":"After reviewing our analytics data, I noticed three trends:",
				"Bullets":["There was a distinct drop-off in our enrollment flow at a point", "Users seldom changed the default information in our enrollment wizard, preferring to just click through", "For users who did complete enrollment, they were less likely to implement our recommended guidance, as compared to our advisor-led flow."],
				"image":"AnalyticsDashboard.png"
				},
				{"Subtitle":"Synthesis", 
				"Paragraph":"Based on analytics trends, additional research was focused on the enrollment flow and the recommendation proposal displaed. We learned that our users were not willing to put up with a lengthy enrollment flow and often completed the flow by relying on the default values we suggested. We needed to speed up the process and provide a faster 'time to value'. Once users landed on the proposal, users had difficulty understanding the suggested recommendations; the existing hierarchy and structure of information displayed on the proposal was not aligned with the mental model in our users' heads.",

			"section":[
				{"Subtitle":"Enrollment Flow Improvements", 
				"Paragraph":"Without another person guiding them through the questions, users were discouraged by the number of questions asked and not as patient. The enrollment wizard was pared down to the questions that users were most likely to answer and change from their default value. Later on, users would receive notifications to update the defaulted answers for more personalized recommendations. This allowed users to see their initial results and understand the direct impact of further personalization.",

				},
				{"Subtitle":"Recommendation Proposal Improvements", 
				"Paragraph":"Based on our research, we identified the key metrics people used to think about retirement and highlighted those metrics at the forefront of the proposal. Also, the proposal page layout was updated to present current and proposed information at the same time instead of requiring users to tab back and forth between the scenarios presented. This allowed users to better understand what their recommended actions were and compare different scenarios before committing to a decision. These proposal improvements are reflected in the UI as well as the PDF used as a confirmation of their selected actions. ",
