            <div class="content">
                <p>For many college students, budget is the limiting factor for everything when it comes to traveling (flights, hotels, etc.). Students in particular don’t really have a disposable income, so their budget is smaller and becomes a real obstacle to traveling.

            <h2 class="heading">Solution</h2>
            To solve this problem, we came up with the idea of creating a google extension.

        <div class="Process section card-panel">
            <h2 class="heading">NeedFinding and Personas</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>We went through a series of 7 need-finding interviews each, ( a total of 28) where we hoped to learn more about travel planning as an overall process and find out where people encountered problems. After these interviews, we aggregated our data and created an affinity diagram.
                <br/><br/>
                Looking at our affinity diagram, we noticed that one of the biggest categories in terms of frustrations was the actual booking process and the number of tools they had to use. In our interviews, we noted that while planning their trips, people often had many tabs open since there were so many aspects involved in  travel planning, such as booking a flight and hotel, renting a car, and creating an itinerary. As a result, we narrowed down our problem space to travel planning structure. <br/><br/>

                We went through a second round of interviews to look at specifically why travel planning necessitated the usage of an abundance of different tools. We realized that the complicated nature of travel planning wasactually a symptom that resulted from trying to travel plan with a budget. We redefined our problem space to focus on travel budgeting. <br/><br/>

                We sent out a survey via Facebook to gather some quantitative data on the current status of student travel budgeting. From our results, over 50% of students claimed to budget. However, when we compared this to our interview data, it was clear that what they said they did and what they actually did was very different. Our interview data showed us that people explicitly mentioned trying to cut costs by budgeting for flight and hotel but often did not go much farther than that. When pressed about budgeting, their responses in person were more often a “kinda” rather than a strong affirmative “yes”.

                We noticed three general types of travelers:<br/>
                <span style="font-weight:bold"> Nick:Poor Spontaneous Jobless Student </span>Nick is a 19-year-old currently in college. He is interested in traveling internationally but does not have a very big budget, all he has is the money in his savings account. His money comes from saving up while he worked at a student job at the local dining halls for minimum pay. He is spontaneously looking into traveling within a few weeks. When traveling, his lack of money lends him to seek out local attractions. He likes to visit lesser-known/hole-in the wall places. As an English major, he hopes to write about his experiences and as a result wants an out-of-the-box adventure. <br/>
                Goals:<br/>
                spend his break in a different country with his friends<br/>
                Frustrations:<br/>
                his budget constrains his options<br/>
                has a limited amount of time to deal with logistics<br/>
                budget is extremely fixed<br/>
                only has certain time options to travel (ie. winter/spring/summer break)<br/>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Wyatt:Working Budget-minded College Graduate: </span> Wyatt is a 23-year-old who has recently graduated college and has a stable middle-class income. He has been saving up money for a trip for awhile now but still has a tight budget. However, it is more flexible since he has a steady source of income. In addition, he has more flexibility on when to travel as long as he tells his boss. His focus has been on gaining a stable career and as result, he wants to go wild on his trip. In addition, he is hoping to use this trip as an opportunity to see his college friends. He wants to take this time to recuperate and relax from the daily 9-5 grind.<br/>
                Goals:<br/>
                take a break from work on a careful budget<br/>
                Frustrations:<br/>
                his budget constrains his options (loose but still there)<br/>
                must coordinate travel times with friends<br/>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Jane:Parental Travel Fund:</span> Jane is a 19-year-old college student whose parents value traveling a lot and are willing to fund any of her desires to travel. Her family is well-off and she is not particularly concerned about budgeting. However, she is still constrained to a reasonable budget amount, particularly since she is traveling with her friends who do have a budget. She wants to pack as much things to do in one trip and is looking forward to trying the main attractions at each location. She considers herself a foodie and as a result, food will be allotted a larger portion of her budget.
                <br/>
                Goals:<br/>
                travel somewhere for vacation<br/>
                Frustrations:<br/>
                have to take into account other people’s budgets<br/>
                must plan logistic to be cheaper (cheap hotel/flight)<br/><br/>

            <h2 class="heading">Ideation, Prototypes, and User Testing</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>After testing our prototype with a number of students, we found that student travelers also struggled with estimating the total cost of their trip as well as estimating how much they should be spending on flights, hotels, and other aspects of their trip. We performed deeper research and found inspiration from The Lonely Planet, a travel information website. The website’s destination pages actually showed visitors an estimate of their costs as well as variations based on how luxurious the trip would be.
