                <p>For our Cognitive Design Studio project, we focused our problem on budgeting with college students. After conducting research in the form of interviews and surveys, we iterated on paper prototypes to come up with a final solution. <br/>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Following a series of need-finding interviews, we used an affinity diagram to focus in on the number of tools needed to be used. However, we later learned that this was actually just a symptom of the real problem, budgeting. For many college students, budget is the limiting factor for everything when it comes to traveling (flights, hotels, etc.). Students in particular don’t really have a disposable income, so their budget is smaller and becomes a real obstacle to traveling.

       <div class="Final Solution section card-panel">
            <h2 class="heading">Solution</h2>
            <p>To solve this problem, we came up with the idea of creating a Google extension. This would let users see how much they are literally using on their trip. By having a Google extension, this budget could follow the user from each travel website they use. We also wanted to include budget estimators since students did not know how much they should be spending. Budgets would be categorized by different levels of spending profiles so they could be adjusted accordingly. </p>

            <h2 class="heading">NeedFinding and Personas</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>We went through a series of 7 need-finding interviews each, (a total of 28) and aggregated our data to create an affinity diagram, letting us focus on our problem space.

                We sent out a survey via Facebook to gather some quantitative data on the current status of student travel budgeting. From our results, over 50% of students claimed to budget. However, when we compared this to our interview data, it was clear that what they said they did and what they actually did was very different. Our interview data showed us that people explicitly mentioned trying to cut costs by budgeting for flight and hotel but often did not go much farther than that. When pressed about budgeting, their responses in person were more often a “kinda” rather than a strong affirmative “yes”.

                We noticed three general types of travelers:<br/>
                <span style="font-weight:bold"> Nick: Poor Spontaneous Jobless Student </span>Nick is a 19-year-old currently in college. He is interested in traveling internationally but does not have a very big budget, all he has is the money in his savings account. His money comes from saving up while he worked at a student job at the local dining halls for minimum pay. He is spontaneously looking into traveling within a few weeks. When traveling, his lack of money lends him to seek out local attractions. He likes to visit lesser-known/hole-in the wall places. As an English major, he hopes to write about his experiences and as a result wants an out-of-the-box 
                only has certain time options to travel (ie. winter/spring/summer break)<br/>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Wyatt: Working Budget-minded College Graduate: </span> Wyatt is a 23-year-old who has recently graduated college and has a stable middle-class income. He has been saving up money for a trip for awhile now but still has a tight budget. However, it is more flexible since he has a steady source of income. In addition, he has more flexibility on when to travel as long as he tells his boss. His focus has been on gaining a stable career and as result, he wants to go wild on his trip. In addition, he is hoping to use this trip as an opportunity to see his college friends. He wants to take this time to recuperate and relax from the daily 9-5 grind.<br/>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Jane: Parental Travel Fund:</span> Jane is a 19-year-old college student whose parents value traveling a lot and are willing to fund any of her desires to travel. Her family is well-off and she is not particularly concerned about budgeting. However, she is still constrained to a reasonable budget amount, particularly since she is traveling with her friends who do have a budget. She wants to pack as much things to do in one trip and is looking forward to trying the main attractions at each location. She considers herself a foodie and as a result, food will be allotted a larger portion of her budget.
