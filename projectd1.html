                <h4 >Overview</h4>
                <div class="content">
                    <h5>Role/Tools</h5>
                    <p>This was a four person team project and we shared the work of conducting need-finding research to narrow our design space evenly.<br> <b>Tools:</b>Paper prototypes, Interviews, Surveys, Observations, Affinity Diagram, Personas, Data model</p>
                    <h5> Problem</h5>
                    <p>For our Cognitive Design Studio project, we looked at the problem space of travel planning. After conducting interviews, observations and a survey, we narrowed down our problem space to travel budgeting. We noticed that our audience, college students, did not have a good grasp on how to create a budget for traveling and how much their trips would cost. In addition, they were very money-conscious, looking for deals but often did not know how to tell if they were getting a good deal.

                    </p>
                    <h5>Solution</h5>
                    <p> While initially, we considered creating a platform letting users compare flight, hotel and other travel costs, we realized that plenty of these platforms exist already so we concluded that was not the desired solution. Our final solution comes in the form of a browser extension. After user’s input their travel budget, location and desired dates, we can show what the average costs of other people who went on similar trips were. As a browser extension, this information is accessible to the user irregardless of what travel planning platform they are on. This unifies all the aspects of travel planning. Then, as they plan their trip, they can add the costs in the extension and see how their budget is being used and if it is practical. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Challenges</h5>
                    <p> Among the challenges we faced in this project, our decision to pivot, while critical to our solution, also meant we had do follow up interviews to delve in the direction we wanted to since our original interviews were insufficient. In addition, testing our prototype was difficult because we were giving our users imaginary trip prompts. People were not as invested as they would've been had it been a real trip. In addition, real trip planning is time intensive and it is possible people did not put in that amount of time for prototype testing.

                    <h5>Interviews and Observations</h5>
                    <p>We conducted a total of 28 need-finding interviews. For each interview, we asked the interviewee to plan a trip as we watched. Then, we came together as a team and wrote down all the pain points on post it notes to create an affinity diagram. From our affinity diagram, we noticed that the complexity of travel planning leading users to have a lot of tabs open seemed like a key pain point. We conducted a second round of interviews leading us to conclude the reason this was a problem was because people had trouble budgeting. The third round of interviews involved going back to our original 20 interviewees and gathering more information surrounding the issue of budgeting. We asked them follow up questions surrounding the idea of budgeting, whether or not they budget for a trip, how they budget, and what aspects they budget for. We found that college students, who have a limited amount of leisure expenses, budget the least. Very rarely did we find that someone budgeted and took into account so many different aspects to travel planning.</p>
                        <b>Analyzing collected data</b>
                        <div class="slider">

                            <ul class="slides">

                    <h5>Survey</h5>
                    <p>Now that we had a narrower problem to look at, we sent out a survey to get some quantitative data to back up our qualitative data. Interestingly, over 50% of students claimed to budget (compared to our observations where few of our interviewees budgeted). In addition, when asked how they budgeted, they focused on flights and housing but didn’t go much further than that.</p>
                    <h5>Personas</h5>
                    <p>We noticed three general types of travelers:<br/>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold"> Nick: Poor Spontaneous Jobless Student </span>Nick is a 19-year-old currently in college. He is interested in traveling internationally but does not have a very big budget, all he has is the money in his savings account. His money comes from saving up while he worked at a student job at the local dining halls for minimum pay. He is spontaneously looking into traveling within a few weeks. When traveling, his lack of money lends him to seek out local attractions. He likes to visit lesser-known/hole-in the wall places. As an English major, he hopes to write about his experiences and as a result wants an out-of-the-box 
                    only has certain time options to travel (ie. winter/spring/summer break)<br/>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">Wyatt: Working Budget-minded College Graduate: </span> Wyatt is a 23-year-old who has recently graduated college and has a stable middle-class income. He has been saving up money for a trip for awhile now but still has a tight budget. However, it is more flexible since he has a steady source of income. In addition, he has more flexibility on when to travel as long as he tells his boss. His focus has been on gaining a stable career and as result, he wants to go wild on his trip. In addition, he is hoping to use this trip as an opportunity to see his college friends. He wants to take this time to recuperate and relax from the daily 9-5 grind.<br/>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">Jane: Parental Travel Fund:</span> Jane is a 19-year-old college student whose parents value traveling a lot and are willing to fund any of her desires to travel. Her family is well-off and she is not particularly concerned about budgeting. However, she is still constrained to a reasonable budget amount, particularly since she is traveling with her friends who do have a budget. She wants to pack as much things to do in one trip and is looking forward to trying the main attractions at each location. She considers herself a foodie and as a result, food will be allotted a larger portion of her budget.</p>
                    <h5>Paper Prototypes and User Testing</h5>
                    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Paper prototype 1:</span> 
                    We created a budget tracker website paper prototype but upon testing, we found that many people would not be very willing to use a completely new website, so incorporating this budget visualizer with the websites that people currently use to book the parts of their trip would be the best option. For example, including this bar at the top of the page on Expedia as a Google Chrome extension. This led us to our second effort.<br/>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">Paper prototype 2: </span> Now that it was in the form of a chrome extension, our second round of testing revealed a need for the ability to adjust the budget while on the trip as well as needing an idea of what the budget breakdown looked like at a day-to-day estimate. Users also failed to place accurate budgets into place. <br/>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">Paper Prototype 3: </span> For our final prototype, we added in differing budget estimates for different levels of lifestyles. </p>
