                    <h5>Role/Tools</h5>
                    <p>I focused on needfinding, creating initial wireframes to guide development and front-end coding as well as conducted usability testing with Google Analytics. <br/>
                       <b> Tools: </b> HTML/CSS, Google Analytics, Javascript
                    </p>
                    <h5>Problem</h5>
                    <p> When looking at Facebook events, there are often hundreds of people interested in events but the actual turnout is much lower. We wanted to see if we could improve attendance rates at events. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Solution</h5>
                     <p>We decided to improve ridesharing for events. Even though events are interesting, people are uncomfortable going to events when they do not know anyone and they don't want to go through the hassle of finding a way to get there. We created a mobile web application that pulled events that you were interested in on Facebook. Then you could either offer to drive or find a ride for each event. After inputting your pick-up location, we would find the most efficient route for carpooling purposes. We would also take into account mutual friends and Facebook interests in the hopes that the people you carpool with can be people you socialize with at the events themselves. <br/><br/>
                    <!--h5>Challenges</h5>
                    <p> Among the challenges we faced in this project, our decision to pivot, while critical to our solution, also meant we had do follow up interviews to delve in the direction we wanted to since our original interviews were insufficient. In addition, testing our prototype was difficult because we were giving our users imaginary trip prompts. People were not as invested as they would've been had it been a real trip. In addition, real trip planning is time intensive and it is possible people did not put in that amount of time for prototype testing.
