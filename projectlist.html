<h4>Product-led Growth @SingleStore (2025)</h4>
<p>I worked with our growth PM and VP of Product, to provide a new self-service product-led growth motion. I led a team of designers to revise the end-to-end flow, including documentation site revisions, the sign up and onboarding experience, and touchpoints for converting customers to upgrade their usage.</p>
<h3>Navigation Refresh(2024)</h3>
<p>After observing the user interface was getting overcrowded, I initiated a project to revise the navigation on the platform. I created a new object hierarchy to better align to our customers&#39; mental models and scale with our growing feature set.</p>
<h3>Developer Experience @ SingleStore (2024)</h3>
<p>I led the design for the Developer Experience, a 0-&gt;1 initiative to create a platform that allowed users to develop, deploy and manage everything from SQL scripts to dashboards to LLMs.</p>
<h3>Automations Rule Builder (2022)</h3>
<p>Automations is a rule builder that allows users to automate parts of their work. I joined as the squad’s first product designer and defined our product vision – to make Automations easier to use and more trustworthy.</p>
<h3>Self-service Retirement Wizard (2020)</h3>
<p>Following a pivot in product strategy from financial advisors to the everyday user, I worked to reframe our existing product for a more novice user base, including a simplified onboarding flow and educational dashboard experience. </p>
