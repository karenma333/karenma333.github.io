#### Summary
Working on the Growth team requires a slightly different approach to product design. We rapidly iterate with our engineering team to prototype experiments and focus on improving the number of qualified leads that are funneled down the sales funnel. As a company that is largely B2B, the growth model is less true product-led-growth and more product-led-sales. Our hopes are to intrigue customers to engage further with the sales team.

#### Solution
The experiments we ran for the growth team included updates to the sign up flow, the introduction of a home page, improved tutorials, the introduction of a community tier database with a self-serve upgradability path and a no-code interface for loading data (our target action for new users), among other features.
