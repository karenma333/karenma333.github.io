#### Summary
I led the design for the Developer Experience team. As our growth strategy shifted to target small startups and developers, we needed to adapt our portal, which previously was targeted at an administrator persona to support developer use cases. Not only did the product team have a host of new features we wanted to add, we also needed ux strategy to make developers not feel like an afterthought.

##### Solution
For developing within the platform, we added multi-tab support for SQL and Python Notebooks. We introduced a schema explorer so users could easily see the databases they were querying and see the live updates from their changes. We also took a look at the connection experience for developers who preferred their own IDE to make it a seamless transition from database admin to coding in VS Code or their IDE of choice. 

#### Outcomes
Our introduction of enhanced developer tools in the platform meant we could transition our onboarding tutorials to be interactive files that our customers could run in the platform. We were also able to customize the onboarding experience with different tutorials, leading to a more personal experience. For our existing customers, we unlocked a way for them to keep all their database scripting in one spot, close to the rest of the administrative settings.
