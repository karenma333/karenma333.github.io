#### Summary
After observing the user interface was getting overcrowded, I initiated a project to revise the navigation on the platform. I created a new object hierarchy to better align to our customers' mental models and scale with our growing feature set.


#### Solution
This navigation project was scoped to solve for the following themes:
- Scale with feature development
- Keep it clean and focused
- Prevent users from losing context
- Orient users

#### Outcomes
We did a staged rollout, starting with an opt-in for existing customers and a default onto the new navigation for new customers. After 60 days, we saw an adoption of 20% of customers showing a preference for the new scheme. We defaulted all users to roll onto the new UI and after 30 day mark saw over 90% of customers using the new navigation.
