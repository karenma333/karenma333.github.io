Automations (2020)

Context

What happens when a feature is released and isn’t as successful as you hoped? In this case, I worked to understand how the released functionality did manage to improve user workflows and what prevented the feature from becoming even more useful. Additional user research informed tweaks to how the existing features operated to improve adoption and usage.


Product Opportunity

In an effort to provide users with more visibility into their automations, a basic execution history and upcoming schedule was created for users. While conducting user research on a related project, it became clear that the MVP feature release of an automated jobs execution history and jobs schedule did not fully solve user problems. Instead of providing clarity, this actually brought about more questions and concerns about jobs.
Users disagreed with our definitions. Our decisions for what job executions succeeded or failed didn’t make sense to the users.
They wanted more details. It wasn’t enough to know that a job had failed, users needed to know why something failed. Likewise, if a job claims to have succeeded but they didn’t see evidence, they wanted reassurance of what actions were actually executed.


As the team’s first designer, I was offered a blank slate to reimagine automations in our platform. After extensive user research, I identified actionable next steps to improve the existing functionality and established a longer term product vision to guide future feature discovery.

he current creation flow to set up an automated job didn’t match users’ mental model. When watching new users, they struggled to understand what each step was asking for and where to click next. They were not able to quickly resolve any errors they encountered. The existing affordances were not clear to users, and even our power users sometimes misclicked during routine tasks.
Users needed an overview. Since you could only see one part of a job at one time, users were constantly clicking back and forth to reference information. 

Our jobs were hacky. Our power users proudly introduced us to a series of workarounds to create automated jobs. While it worked, it meant our existing functionality wasn’t exactly doing what users needed.

 Creation Flow

 IA sidebar now displays the entire job in one view, allowing users to reference information from previous steps and easily understand what a job is supposed to do at one glance.

Conditions can now be added prior to saving a job, allowing users to create their jobs in the order that makes sense to them. 

Operations have been atomized to be more distinct and allow for a future with multiple operations.

Terminology was updated to be more user-friendly and less technical in nature so that users had a clear understanding of what was being automated. 
More explicit warning and error messages provided users with necessary guidance in areas where users were particularly prone to error.
