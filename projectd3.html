                    <h5>Role/Tools</h5>
                    <p> As a team of four, we each took equivalent roles in conducting observations, and user research in the form of interviews. <br> <b>Tools:</b>Paper prototypes, Interviews, Observations</p>
                    <h5> Problem</h5>
                    <p>At UCSD, we have a high number of student commuters. Even with school shuttles and public transit, getting to campus can be difficult. Buses are extremely crowded and often have to skip stops because they are already at max capacity. We wanted to find improvements for the way commuters ride the bus.

                    </p>
                    <h5>Solution</h5>
                    <p> After coming up with a variety of different solutions, we settled on a final solution. The public transit buses have a circular area to accommodate turns, an accordion "pivot point", that currently has two seats. Since the area rotates on its own separate from the rest of the bus, it can be hard to stand there and the proximity of the two seats makes it awkward. To maximize space, it would be best improved by inputting a series of poles for holding onto instead. This way, instead of holding two people, it can hold closer to 6-8 people. In addition, the trade off is merely two seats. At non-peak hours, the seating capacity is minimally changed. 

                    </p>
                    <h5>Challenges</h5>
                    <p> We wanted photographic and video evidence of the behaviors we were observing, however, the idea of photographing strangers was difficult to normalize and while we did take some photos, we had to keep a lot of mental notes that could not be written down right away.

                    <h5>Interviews and Observations</h5>
                    <p>We started off observing commuters on our own commutes to school to observe problems. Since each of us had different class schedules, rode different buses and got on at different stops, we were able to observe a wide variety of different problems. We noticed that people standing tended to stop at the stairs or near exit doors, instead of going to the very back of the bus. We also noticed that people would not use the strap loops intended for them to hold on. Instead, shorter riders would grab onto seat handles. Students were unwilling to place their backpacks on the ground, which would’ve created more space. In longer buses, students would be constrained by the accordion “pivot point” for standing area. In general, we noticed a difference between the conceptual models of the riders and the reality of the bus design. We chose to focus here and conducted interviews with this information.<br/><br/>
                    From our interviews, we learned that close to everyone we interviewed chose vertical poles as their preferred way of keeping balance. Since they are grasp-able at any point, users have more control over their own comfort. The next best option they reported was seat handles. Roughly half of the people we interviewed reported benefitting from seat handles. Standing passengers prefer solid holds as opposed to the more flimsy loops on the horizontal bars.

                            <li><img src="assets/images/busObs1.jpg"></li>
                            <li><img src="assets/images/busObs2.png"></li>
                            <li><img src="assets/images/busAxis.png"></li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>                               
                    <h5>Possible Solutions</h5>
                    <p>We considered a few different ways of resolving the problem and compared the pros and cons of each solution before we settled on our final idea. <br/><span style="font-weight:bold">Vertical Poles:</span> 
                    Since we saw a marked preference for vertical poles, we considered the replacement of the seat handles with vertical poles. This would be a very simple modification to make and would not need the current fleet of buses to be completely redesigned. However, this placement of poles means that at best, two people would be able to utilize this as opposed to previous one rider able to use the original seat handle.  <br/>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">Motorized Strap Handles: </span> Having noticed that few passengers used the strap handles, we sought to improve them. We noticed that the strap handles were often in the way of taller passengers getting up. While some models were movable, this led to them being pushed to the side of a vertical pole and then neglected. We thought that by creating a motorized system, this would force/encourage riders to move to the back to bus, with their handle. In addition, an adjusted height means that the length of the strap handle could be made comfortable per person, much like vertical poles. In reality, we recognized this system seemed over complicated and that in peak hours, the motorized system could be cause for accidents. The space it would take up to implement this would also negate any comfort it creates for passengers. <br/>
