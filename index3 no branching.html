						<h3>Design Operations (2020-)</h3>
						<p>Learning & Development, Culture, Design Quality </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p> As a designer at multiple growth-stage startups, processes are often nonexistent. Both as an individual contributor and as a manager, I've found it is important to me to define processes and explore ways to improve team workflow where I can. </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Because a key part of designing is participating in critiques of each others' work, it is essential to have a strong culture of trust and willingness to receive feedback. At Singlestore, I've introduced new working models, such as paired designing, moonshot workshops, and team sprints to encourage team bonding across a global team, reduce information silo-ing and keep things fresh. </li>
							<li>I've worked to uplift the quality of our designs by defining core design principles and introduced recurring ux audits. </li>
							<li>I revised the planning process and standardized a UI rollout strategy to provide stability for designers and more transparency across the engineering and product roadmaps. </li>
							<li>Across several teams, I created interview rubrics, interview exercises and guides to standardize candidate evaluations. I created and revised career ladders to reflect a growing team's needs. </li>	
						</ul>

						<h3>Design System Contributions (2021-)</h3>
						<p>Components, Best Practices, Documentation</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Design systems are key to a fully functioning design team. A design system allows designers to be efficient and cohesive in their designs. It provides a standard for both designers and engineers to follow, reducing hand-off confusion and time-to-deliver new features by reusing existing patterns. Design systems allow designers to spend their time on more high value problems instead of worrying about the smaller details which should be pre-defined within the design system. </p>						
						<ul>
							<li>As part of each of my roles, I have contributed to several internal design systems by auditing existing components for consistency, as well as creating and documenting new components. </li>
							<li>In one case, where we lacked a dedicated content writer, I also spent time working on guidelines for content, such as error messages, help text and empty states. I facilitated a workshop to define our voice and wrote documentation for a more cohesive copywriting methodology. </li>

						<h3>Product-led Growth @ SingleStore(2023 -)</h3>
						<p>Freemium Trials, Generative Research, Strategic Vision </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>In my time at SingleStore, we shifted from a trial experience to a free forever model. I worked with our growth PM and VP of Product to ship existing features on the product roadmap and propose new initiatives based on generative research on target customer profiles.</p>
							<ul>
								<li> As an individual contributor, I led the design for the Developer Experience, a 0->1 feature that allowed users to develop, deploy and manage everything from SQL scripts to dashboards to LLMs</li>
								<li>In the role of a player-coach, I identified existing pain points across the end-to-end user journey by conducting user interviews and analyzing our collected data on existing trial users. After aligning the results with the long term company vision, I led a team of designers to propose a series of projects for the roadmap, including documentation site revisions, new user onboarding educational material, and touchpoints for engaging customers to upgrade their plans.</li>

						<h3>Navigation Refresh (2024)</h3>
						<p>Information Architecture, User Research, Stakeholder Management</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p> After observing the user interface was getting overcrowded, I initiated a project to revise the navigation on the platform. I was able to take a holistic approach to this project and address several other pain points that had resulted due to the constraints of the existing navigation scheme</p>	
						<ul>
							<li>I created a new object hierarchy to better align to our customers mental models and accommodate our growing business.</li>
							<li>I identified core user personas and workflows by talking to customers</li>
							<li>Because a navigation change affects everyone, this project involved a lot of stakeholders. Everyone had an opinion and I needed to gain alignment across all product areas by having clear rationale and evidence backing each of my design decisions. Additionally, I needed to coordinat the rollout with Engineering, Support, Sales and Marketing.</li>

					<h3>Automations Rule Builder (2022)</h3>
					<p>Taxonomy, Design Evangelization</p>
					</div>	
					<div>
						<p>Automations, a rule builder that allowed users to automate parts of their work had long existed in the application. However, it proved too confusing for users and as a result, most automations were built by customer support staff on behalf of our customers. As the squad’s first product designer, I worked to define our long-term product strategy and immediate next steps. </p>							
						<ul>
							<li>After conducting some discovery research and facilitating a series of product workshops, we concluded that we needed to make Automations easier to use and more trustworthy. A interface without such a sharp learning curve would allow us to shift the user base from our internal customer support staff back to our users. Without this move, scaling the product would require hiring more staffers. In addition to the rule builder itself, we needed to provide new features to increase trust from our users. </li>			
							<li>This project required an overhaul to taxonomy, for more user-friendly language, an overhaul to the rule building interface, as well as the addition of several audit capabilities, such as a history log, customer facing alerts, and automations preview, to provide a users a way to see what was going on. </li>	
							</ul>

						<h3>Self-service Retirement Wizard (2020)</h3>
						<p>B2B -> B2C, Strategic Pivots</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Following a pivot in product strategy from financial advisors to the every day user, I worked to reframe our existing product for a more novice user base, including a simplified onboarding flow and educational dashboard experience.  </p>							
						<ul>
							<li>For this project, I worked on the onboarding and dashboard designs with a team of two other designers, as well as leading the technical integrations with 401k plan providers. This was also the first introduction of user experience design into the product development process, requiring design evangelization to the org. </li>
							<li>I led generative research to shape our design strategy for the new target audience and set up usability metrics to inform iterations as we started shipping our features. Novice users were overwhelmed by personalization options in the original interface and needed more education on recommended actions. Not only did we see an increase in users, we also saw better outcomes for our users, for a product-led growth strategy. </li>
						</ul>

			<p>I started my career in product design because of my interest in Cognitive Science; I loved the interaction between the behavioral research and analytics and the technical applications of the field. Now, work keeps me engaged when I get to spend time discussing product strategy and product vision, writing new guidelines for design systems and growing design culture. Outside of work,I also mentor on <a href ="https://www.get-merit.com/p/karen-ma" target = "_blank">Merit </a>
