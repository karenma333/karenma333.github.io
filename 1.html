								<p>Our initial display used a tabbing format to allow users to compare different scenarios. However, we saw user confusion. They did not understand why the values are changing and why not all of the values changed. </p>

								<p class = "bold" role="heading" aria-level="3">Improved content through consistency</p>
								<p>A content review was undertaken,  reviewing the copy, such as help text and info buttons, leading to standardized key terminology to reduce the vocabulary on the page.  Additionally, rules for displays of numbers were put in place, allowing for consistent expecatations of rounding and precision.</p>

								<p class = "bold" role="heading" aria-level="3">User controlled saving mechanisms</p>
								<p>Previously, all changes were saved on blur, as soon as users clicked out of a editable box. This ensured information was always as up-to-date as possible but wasted a lot of time. Updates were made so the save behavior only occurred when a user clicks a save button, allowing users more freedom to interact without having their user flow interrupted by loading time.</p>

								<p>Given the timeline of the project, the primary focus for the first launch was to build a good foundation by setting up design patterns to follow when iterating on the application.  Not only does this new redesign make use of our new visual design library, it also puts into place user experience guidelines from content strategy to interaction design patterns.</p>
