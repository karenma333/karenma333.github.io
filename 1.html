					<h3> PRODUCT OPPORTUNITY</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-7">
					<p>In transitioning our product to be investor-facing, we saw drop off rates of 60% in our onboarding wizard. Combined with user data, I sought to propose an improved wizard experience. </p>

					<h3> USER RESEARCH</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-7">
					<p>Talking to some of our end users, I found out that users were discouraged due to the lack of progress indicators; they couldn&#x27;t tell how many more steps were in the progress. I combined this with analytics data on which steps in the existing wizard were most important by referencing time spent on the step and user interactions on the step.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="background full_photo">
					<img src="./public/images/AnalyticsDashboard.png" alt="55% of users failed to complete the wizard, more than 84% made zero interactions on the last three steps.">

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-5">	
					<h3> INITIAL THOUGHTS</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-7">
					<p>Using the user data, I decreased the steps in the wizard and adjusted the proposal page to have calls to action for any users who would&#x27;ve been interested in those steps. This allowed the wizard to cater to the larger audience while still supporting the smaller segments of our target audience.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="background full_photo">
					<img src="./public/images/wizardComparison.png" alt="Compared to the original wizard, 4 steps were condensed into 1 single quesionnaire, and 3 steps were condensed into one projection screen.">

					<h3> REALISTIC CONSTRAINTS</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-7">
					<p>Based on the tight two week deadline, I needed to adjust the designs to work within the current component system and minimize the implementation work needed. Talking to technical leads and also identifying the key information necessary led to a streamlined one step wizard, also eliminating the need for a step counter.</p>

					<h3> FINAL SOLUTION</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-7">
					<p>In the end, I landed on a one step wizard consisting of the primary important information. As a one step wizard, no step counter is necessary. I&#x27;ve shortened the amount of time it takes for a user to get to see the primary value of the product. Since launch, total number of enrolled users have increased 68%. The rate of new user enrollment has multiplied 5x from the previous iteration.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="background full_photo">
					<img src="./public/images/finalWizardFlow.png" alt="Compared to the original wizard, 9 steps were condensed into a 1 page form.">

					<h3> NEXT STEPS</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-7">
					<p>While the initial solution sought to streamline our enrollment process, and we have successfully moved from a nine-step wizard to a one-step wizard. After talking to subject matter experts, I learned that the most important steps for users to interact with were in the last few steps where we were seeing less than 20% interaction. The original wizard was lengthy in order to prove users with a sense of personalization but failed to actually encourage personalization. How can we improve and highlight the need for users to provide important information?</p>
