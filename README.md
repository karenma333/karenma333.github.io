## Format
Originally built dynamically with Express and Handlebars Templating, the discovery of Github Pages as only supporting static pages has shifted this project. 

Now, it consists of handlebars templates filled by separate json files per page. These are compiled using a gulp script to be served statically. 

Previous files related to the dynamic version of this site may still exist in this repo but can be ignored.
