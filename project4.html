                            <p>For many college students, budget is the limiting factor for everything when it comes to traveling (flights, hotels, etc.). Students in particular don’t really have a disposable income, so their budget is smaller and becomes a real obstacle to traveling. </p>

                            <p>UCPool is a mobile web application designed to help people find rides to the events they're interested in. Users would log in via Facebook since Facebook seemed to be the way most people found events to go to. To provide a level of safety, we limited our audience to UCSD students and required email verification. Once they enter our application, they can click on an event and offer or request a ride to an event. Then based on the desired address and their Facebook friends/interests, we would match riders and drivers with the aim of not just providing them with a ride to an event but also a new friend to enjoy the event with.<br/><br/>

                            <p>We went through a series of 7 need-finding interviews each, ( a total of 28) where we hoped to learn more about travel planning as an overall process and find out where people encountered problems. After these interviews, we aggregated our data and created an affinity diagram. <br/><br/>

                            <img class="research" src="assets/images/travelbudget/affinitydiagram.png">

                           Looking at our affinity diagram, we noticed that one of the biggest categories in terms of frustrations was the actual booking process and the number of tools they had to use. In our interviews, we noted that while planning their trips, people often had many tabs open since there were so many aspects involved in  travel planning, such as booking a flight and hotel, renting a car, and creating an itinerary. As a result, we narrowed down our problem space to travel planning structure. <br/><br/>

                            We went through a second round of interviews to look at specifically how people planned. We wanted to know what was the reason why travel planning was complicated. Why did travel planning necessitate the usage of an abundance of different tools and was there any way we could improve how people planned their trips.  We wanted to see what items they prioritized and why.<br/><br/>

                            When we looked at our research again, we realized that we had misinterpreted our data. The complicated nature of travel planning was not the problem we were looking for. Rather, it was a symptom that resulted from trying to travel plan with a budget. We redefined our problem space once again to travel budgeting.<br/><br/>

                            We sent out a survey via Facebook to gather some quantitative data on the current status of student travel budgeting. From our results, over 50% of students claimed to budget. However, when we compared this to our interview data, it was clear that what they said they did and what they actually did was very different. Our interview data showed us that people explicitly mentioned trying to cut costs by budgeting for flight and hotel but often did not go much farther than that. When pressed about budgeting, their responses in person were more often a “kinda” rather than a strong affirmative “yes”.

                <section class="Prototypes section">
                    <div class="section-inner">
                        <h2 class="heading">Ideation, Prototypes, and User Testing</h2>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Based on our initial idea to improve itinerary planning, we created paper prototypes and used Wizard of Oz to test out our idea with people we knew were in the process of planning trips for the summer.  We also created two branding options and bought ads on Google to see if our product would generate visuals/clicks by people searching on the internet. Our two branding alternatives were not only visually different but also tried to appeal to a different type of persona. This way we could also see if we needed to gear our product towards a particular audience. <br/><br/>

                            From this, we learned that we did get clicks on our ads but the conversion rates (email sign ups) were the same for both branding options. This affirmed our belief that our product would not be specialized for its audience. We also found that even when using a product designed to show you the cheapest flights, hotels, best food, etc, people would still double check on other websites. As a result, there is a refusal to just check Expedia or just check Google Flights. We also noticed that websites that aimed to simplify steps for users by having flights, hotels, and car rentals at the same site did not affect user behavior. This led us to believe that with the internet at our fingertips, users are unwilling to trust one website or one application to do everything for them and would rather just put in some extra time themselves. <br/><br/>

                            In line with our needfinding interviews, our testers said they used Google Docs and felt like having an itinerary that was just on a map would not be enough because Google Docs allows them to take notes. This led us to deciding to allow users to add notes to each destination. In addition, one user noted that just because he looks up a lot of things doesn’t mean he intends to do all them of. This led us to consider how to note points of interests without having them on the explicit itinerary. We accomplished this by having a separate category to list all points of interest that users don’t want to be set into an itinerary. <br/><br/>
                            While discussing these features, another user brought up the need for offline maps since wifi is not always readily available and when traveling internationally, data can be expensive to use. From this comment, we realized that traveling, especially internationally, leads to a lot of small inconveniences. This became a main focus of our application. We wanted to have it easier for users to find bathrooms, public transit, and wifi hotspots. We also realized that many of the websites we rely on, such as Yelp for restaurants, are not international. We decided to tackle this by automatically using the local version of Yelp to provide food. For example, when going to Hong Kong, restaurants tend to be rated by Open Rice and in New Zealand, Zomato is more popular than yelp.<br/><br/>
                            One of the last insights we came up with was photo spots. As we were thinking of features, we considered the importance of photography while traveling. So, as we went through our paper prototypes we showed users this feature and questioned their social media habits. Essentially, with the rise of social media, often the photos taken while traveling are just as important as the experiences. As is such, we decided to give photo spot recommendations in the application as well as consider how photogenic our navigation routes are. For example, if a route is a minute longer but passes by a series of murals, it would be more desirable. <br/><br/>
